<h3>Overview</h3>
This app was developed as part of a software development course assignment. In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Enjoy!
